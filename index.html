      Dear beloved geego, <br><br>
      i cant believe im actually writing u something inside vscode. to push on github for you to see, however. <br>
      since the last day we hung out in, i needed to send this somewhere in the world where it can wait patiently, like i do for you.<br>
      do u remember when i lifted u onto that wall and you ended up hugging me from the back like you never wanted to let go? yeah. i havent felt this safe in a long time, a feeling so warm to the point i forgot everything. that moment, that feeling. <br>
      made me feel like i can hold the entire world if it meant holding you. <br><br>
      and when your nose wouldnt stop bleeding? i stayed, not because i felt pressured to. but because like always, leaving never felt like an option. you looked at me that day like i was the one person who wouldnt walk away,<br>
      i mean it. i still do. <br>
      i know that ur in the same state as mine, replaying everything in a loop, probably afraid, everytime i feel like we are close enough to touch forever, something reminds us we're not allowed to want it.<br>
      that distance, the inability to just text all day till our bodies collapse into sleep at night, it consumes. but it hasnt consumed what i feel for you.<br>
      if anything, it has made me realize how deep you run in my veins, how much i burn when you're not around. i need u to know that i still carry all of it with me, when im not around, every word every touch every second that passed... it stays with me until i see you again, wont change a thing because u r amazing <br>
      i confess this not because i expect anything but because its the truth.<br>
      i love you in unfathomable ways, deep down you're the one that knows.<br>
      i think about you all the time, literally. in spaces i should be focused somewhere else, i hold back from saying your name out loud in my room. <br>
      you became this substance that runs in my blood, distributed to every cell with every heart beat. a shape in my thoughts <br>
      a name my heart doesnt forget when my voice is quiet.<br>
      im not going anywhere even when i cant be near, even when i cant text, even when i cant say what i want to scream.<br>
      i was never there just for good days. i was there for the ones where the world fell like it would collapse, the dont disappear on me ones, also the cracked ones. <br>
      and i still am, thats not changing.<br><br>
      yours eternally, <br>
      still here,<br>
      still am.<br><br>
      PS: THE NEW PLAYLIST IS SO GOOD, I CANT HELP BUT SHIVER WHEN SUPERNATURAL PLAYED<BR>I FUCKING LOVE U SO MUCH.
